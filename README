Assumptions:

	1. The orders in the input file are for the orderes received in the same day.
	2. In case some orders cannot be delivered on a particular day, their timestamps are updated to the next day, and saved in a file.
	3. If order locations are outside of delivery radius (more than 100 units in N, S, E, W), then they are not delivered, 
	   and also not counted towards NPS calculation.
=======================================================================================================================================================

Project Structure:

	1. Interface: 
		TaskScheduler.java: With the assumption that Walmart will have default scheduler, every scheduler should be implmenting a certain interface.
		Hence, the DroneScheduler will implement this interface.
		
	2. Classes:
		2.1. Application.java: Main class, runs the application.
		2.2. DroneScheduler.java: The scheduler for the Drone deliveries. It reads the orders from the input file, schedules the orders, 
								writes the output schedule in a file, and also calculates NPS score.								
		2.3. OrderInputFileParser: Parser helper for DroneScheduler.
		2.4. Coordinates.java: A class for the location coordinates for a order.
		2.5. Order.java : POJO class for Order, contains necessary fields and getter/setters for an individual order.
		
	3. Tests:
		3.1. testPromoter: Checks for a sure promoter.
		3.2. testDetractor: Checks for a sure detractor
		3.3. testNormalOrders: All orders should be promoters. 
		3.4. testOneNeutral: all except one are promoters, and that one is neutral.
		3.5. testOneNotDelivered: One order should not be delivered.
